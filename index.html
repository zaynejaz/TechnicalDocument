                                the performance of a Ferrari in the controlled environment of a race track. Offered since 2006
                                in Mt. Tremblant Canada and now in Austin, Texas, these courses are based on the Corso

                                Located in the heart of the Laurentian Mountains, Le Circuit Mont-Tremblant is an ideal setting for a
